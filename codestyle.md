### Naming Conventions
- `CamelCase`:
    - Types (start with capitals): `MyClass`;
    - Functions (start with lower case): `myMethod`;
- `snake_case`:
    - Variables: `my_variable`;
    
- Constants are all capital: `const int SIZE = 10;`

Use `_` prefix for private members and methods: `_my_private_field`;

### Unit Tests
There should be a test for every implemented feature.
